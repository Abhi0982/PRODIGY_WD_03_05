I am thrilled to share that I have successfully built my weather website and successfully completed my Prodigy project Task - 3 
This is a significant accomplishment that demonstrates my hard work, dedication, and technical skills.
Creating a weather project is a fun and rewarding experience. I have also learnt about the fascinating world of meteorology and develop of programming skills.
